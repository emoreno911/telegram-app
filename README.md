## About the project

Music is an universal language, we are sure that in your mind you have thousands and thousands of songs stored for years, all of them take you to a different moments, memories that are there, and well, who are we kidding, it's easier to remember an “Oops I did it again” by Britney or “All the Small Things” by Blink 182 than all those equations from math class hahaha.

We wanted to build something within reach of your pocket, to play hidden from your boss at the office, in traffic, on boring Sundays when you're tired of watching Netflix or just when you feel like testing your skills at guessing songs, that's where the name comes from, that's where GUESS THE BEAT was born! A mini-app for telegram with a QUIZ style where in a very intuitive way you will have five rounds of fifteen (15) seconds each to listen to the song and then select the correct option, this is possible thanks to the api of **Deezer**. In addition, if you want to enhance your competitive spirit, we have a leaderboard where only la creme de la creme, those who are best guessers, will be included. 

You will also be able to see the total points and the average time of answers in the summary of your profile.

The blockchain integration is done through dynamic Profile NFTs on the **opBNB chain** that contain the user profile information and their scores. If the NFT is not minted, the scores will not be stored for the Leaderboard. 

Using this dynamic approach the metadata of the profile NFT is updated at the end of each match what makes the **opBNB chain** a perfect fit for the dApp due to its insanely low fees and with the implementation of tournaments, prizes will be distributed to the holders of the of the winner profiles.
